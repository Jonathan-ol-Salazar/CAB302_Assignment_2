# CAB302 Assignment 2

This application is the second assessment piece for the CAB302 Unit. The task is to create a piece of Java-based software for a client (hypothetical), 
that will allow them to create and edit VEC format files. 
VEC files are just ASCII-format text files with UNIX-style line endings (that is, LF line endings). 
Each line of a VEC file describes a drawing operation. 

The application provides a GUI similar the Microsoft Paint.
